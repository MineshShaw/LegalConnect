# LegalConnect

## Overview of the Idea

We are developing LegalConnect, a smart platform to connect such professionals as lawyers (corporate, tax), chartered accountants, company secretaries, etc. – hereon to be referred to as ‘service providers’ – with clients seeking their services.

## 1. Purpose

The idea is to build a tool like LinkedIn, but instead of connecting employers and job-seekers, it is for service providers and clients.

## 2. Objectives

We seek to close the gap between the two ends of services in a field that has not found its footing in the technical world so far. With features like an in-built messenger, smart searching tools to find a provider with the right expertise, secure upload and storage of documents, and AI to help analyze and summarize documents/concepts that are out of the layman’s reach, LegalConnect aims to make these services more accessible.

## Problem Statement

### 2.1. Background

In today's digital age, finding reliable legal and financial professionals such as lawyers and chartered accountants (CAs) remains a challenge. Clients often struggle with a lack of transparency, limited accessibility, and difficulty in verifying the credibility of service providers. Meanwhile, legal and financial professionals face challenges in reaching potential clients and managing their online presence effectively.

### 2.2. Issues Identified

Existing solutions are either fragmented, expensive, or lack a user-friendly interface to facilitate seamless connections between clients and professionals. There is a need for a platform that bridges this gap by providing a trusted, accessible, and efficient solution for both clients and service providers.

### 2.3. Impact

If unaddressed, clients will struggle to find trustworthy legal and financial professionals, leading to delays, higher costs, and potential legal risks. Professionals will face difficulties in reaching clients, limiting their growth and visibility. The lack of a streamlined platform results in inefficient communication and service delivery, reducing trust in the industry. LegalConnect aims to solve these issues by enhancing accessibility, transparency, and efficiency.

## Rough Implementation Plan

### 7.1. Phase-1: Planning Design & Scope (Completed)

### 7.2. Phase-2: Development (Ongoing)
Using React, we are beginning to develop the website for LegalConnect (user-side), using dummy data and placeholder features to get it to a point where all the features can be implemented thoroughly. Authentication and other back-end work is in progress as well. There are many key components to be developed, for clients, providers, and administrators. Once that is complete, each feature is to be integrated seamlessly with one another.

### 7.3. Phase-3: Testing and Quality Assurance
Each feature needs to be tested in all possible methods of use, from all endpoints. The ones which require security protocols must be ensured completely leakproof, such as document uploads and authentication. Tester feedback will also be used to improve user experience and make the interface as intuitive as possible.

### 7.4. Phase-4: Deployment and Rollout
The website is currently being hosted on Vercel, which shall remain its home for the foreseeable future. The server must be kept online as much as possible even as new features keep being rolled out, and we will keep user feedback in mind to catch any issues and resolve them quickly.

### 7.5. Phase-5: Post-Launch and Maintenance
Once LegalConnect is up and running, we will continuously monitor its performance, regulate any issues from the administration dashboard, and focus on keeping it expandable and well-maintained as the scope becomes bigger.
